# Knowledge Hub Static Site

A responsive, single-page "Knowledge Hub" for an engineering office built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Sticky navigation with smooth in-page scrolling
- Light/dark theme toggle with local storage persistence
- Search and category filter for tool cards
- Responsive cards for tools and documentation categories
- Contact form with inline validation feedback

## Run locally
You can preview the site without any setup:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file or drag it into a tab).

If you prefer a local web server (helpful for testing on mobile), start one in the project folder and visit the shown URL:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# or Node.js
npx serve .
```

No build steps or additional dependencies are required—everything runs in the browser.
